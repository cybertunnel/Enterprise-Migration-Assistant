## About The Project

Use Mac Admins have requested for an enterprise type of Migration Assistant from Apple for many years. They have continued to provide no movement on this subject. So [alectrona](https://github.com/alectrona) developed a solution called [migrator](https://github.com/alectrona/migrator). They also presented this during JNUC21, which is where this project began to form. This project uses [alectrona](https://github.com/alectrona)'s thoughts and processes and provides a nice UI on top. Native API calls are performed where possible.
